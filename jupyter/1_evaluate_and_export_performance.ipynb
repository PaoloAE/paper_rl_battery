For each value  of ```nq```, that we denote with ```{nq_val}```, it will:\n",

First 3 panels correspond respectively to the projection of the quantum state onto the eigenstates of $\\mathcal{\\hat H}(t)$, the eigenstates of $\\mathcal{\\hat H}_{\\rm C}$, and the eigenstates of $\\mathcal{\\hat H}_{\\rm B}$; then the y represents the energy, and the x is time, and the color is the square of the projection of the state onto the eigenstates.
